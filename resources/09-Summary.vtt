0:03 Congratulations on making it to the end of this short course.
0:07 In summary, in this short course you've
0:09 learned about two key principles for prompting. Write
0:12 clear and specific instructions, and when it's appropriate, give the
0:16 model time to think. You also learned about iterative
0:19 prompt development and how having a
0:21 process to get to the prompt that's right for
0:24 your application is key. And we went through a few capabilities of large
0:28 language models that are useful for many applications, specifically
0:32 summarizing, inferring, transforming, and expanding.
0:33 And you also saw how to build a
0:36 custom chatbot. That was a lot that you learned in just
0:40 one short course, and I hope you enjoyed going through
0:43 these materials.
0:44 We hope you'll come up with some ideas for applications that
0:47 you can build yourself now. Please go try this out and let us know
0:51 what you come up with. No application is too small, it's fine
0:54 to start with something that's kind of a very small project with
0:57 maybe a little bit of utility or maybe it's not even useful
1:00 at all, it's just something fun.
1:01 Yeah, and I find playing with these models actually really fun,
1:04 so go play with it!
1:06 I agree, it's a good weekend activity, speaking
1:09 from experience.
1:10 Uhm, and just, you know, please use the learnings
1:13 from your first project to build a better
1:15 second project and you know, maybe even a better third project,
1:19 so on. That's kind of how I have kind of grown over time
1:23 using these models myself as well.
1:26 Or if you have an idea for a bigger project already,
1:28 just go for it. And you know, as
1:30 a reminder, these kind of large language models are a very
1:33 powerful technology, so it kind of goes without saying that
1:36 we ask you to use them responsibly and
1:39 please only build things that will have a positive impact.
1:42 Yeah, I fully agree. I think in this age,
1:45 people that build AI systems can have a
1:47 huge impact on others. So it's more important than ever
1:50 that all of us only use these tools responsibly. Uhm, and I think building
1:55 large language model based applications is just a very
1:57 exciting and growing field right now. And
2:00 now that you've finished this course, I think
2:02 you now have a wealth of knowledge that let you build things
2:06 that few people today know how to. So, I hope
2:09 you also help us to spread the word and encourage others to
2:13 take this course too. In closing, I hope
2:16 you had fun doing this course, and I want to thank you for
2:20 finishing this course. And both Ezra and I look forward to hearing about
2:24 the amazing things that you build.
