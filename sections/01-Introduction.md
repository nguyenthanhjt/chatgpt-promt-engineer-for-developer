# Section 1: Introduction

## Overview

In this section, we cover the goals and structure of the 'ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers' course. 

## Key Points

- Course objectives
- Structure of the course
- Expected outcomes

## Notes

- The course is divided into nine sections, each focusing on different aspects of prompt engineering.
- Practical examples and exercises will help reinforce the concepts learned.

- Two types of Large Language Models (LLMs)

- Base LLM: Predicts next word, based on text training data
  - Example:
    - Once upon a time, there was a unicorn -> that lived in a magical forest with all her unicorn friends
    - What is the capital of France? ->
      - What is France's largest city?
      - What is France's population?
      - What is the currency of France?
- Instruction Tuned LLM:
  - Tries to follow instructions
  - Fine-tune on instructions and good attempts at following those instructions
  - RLHF: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
  - Helpful, Honest, Harmless
  - Example:
    - What is the capital of France? -> The capital of France is Paris

## Reflections

- Why is prompt engineering important?
- How can these skills be applied in real-world scenarios?
